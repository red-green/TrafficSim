## intersection definition
# described as a list of 'lane' objects
# lane IDs counter clockwise as shown: (also a list of side lengths: 3,3,3,3 in this case)
#   |0|1|2|
#  -       -
# 11       3
#  -       -
# 10       4

#  -input:
#   where cars come in
#   has list of legal output turns (aka the output lane IDs)
#   probability that a new car will come (number 0-100)
