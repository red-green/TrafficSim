## TrafficSim

Eventually this will do several things:

* [x] Simulate a road intersection with configurable lanes
* [x] Simulate cars going through the intersection
* [x] Make the cars not crash into eachother (WIP)
* [ ] Simulate lights on each lane
* [ ] Count the efficiency of a given light sequence
* [ ] Use a genetic algorithm to genetare new light combinations and find the optimal one 

Wish me luck...
